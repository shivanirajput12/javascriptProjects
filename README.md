## 5. Accordion FAQ

**What is it?**
- An FAQ section where you can click on questions to show or hide the answers. Only one answer opens at a time, but you can also expand or collapse all with buttons.

**Main things used:**
- Event listeners for mouse clicks and keyboard keys (Enter/Space) for accessibility.
- Adding and removing CSS classes to show or hide answers.
- Functions to open all or close all items at once.
- Simple logic to make sure only one answer is open at a time (for better user experience).

**Why these are used:**
- Event listeners let you react to user actions (clicks and key presses).
- Toggling classes is an easy way to show/hide content using CSS.
- Keyboard support makes the FAQ usable for everyone, not just mouse users.
- The open/close all buttons help users quickly see or hide all answers.

**How it works:**
- Click a question or press Enter/Space to open its answer.
- Only one answer is open at a time, unless you use the expand/collapse all buttons.
